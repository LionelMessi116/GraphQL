## [v1.1.1](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql-exchange-graphcache/compare/v1.0.3...v1.1.1)

This is a minor release since it increases the peer dependency of `urql` to `>= 1.6.0`, due to the addition
of the `stale` flag to partial responses and `cache-and-network` responses. This flag is useful to check
whether more requests are being made in the background by `@urql/exchange-graphcache`.

Additionally, this release adds a small stack to every error and warning that indicates where an
error has occured. It lists out the query and all subsequent fragments it has been traversing
so that errors and warnings can be traced more easily.

- Add a query/fragment stack to all errors and warnings (see [#107](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql-exchange-graphcache/pull/107))
- Add `stale: true` to all `cache-and-network` and partial responses (see [#108](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql-exchange-graphcache/pull/108))

## [v1.0.3](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql-exchange-graphcache/compare/v1.0.2...v1.0.3)

- Fix early bail-out in `relayPagination` helper (see [#103](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql-exchange-graphcache/pull/103))

## [v1.0.1](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql-exchange-graphcache/compare/v1.0.0...v1.0.1)

- Trims down the size by 100 bytes (see [#96](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql-exchange-graphcache/pull/96))
- Include the `/extras` build in the published version (see [#97](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql-exchange-graphcache/pull/97))

- Fixes the relayPagination helper to correctly return partial results (see [#101](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql-exchange-graphcache/pull/101))
- Add special case to relayPagination for first and last during inwards merge (see [#102](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql-exchange-graphcache/pull/102))

## [v1.0.0](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql-exchange-graphcache/compare/v1.0.0-rc.11...v1.0.0)

> **Note:** The minimum required version of `urql` for this release is now `1.5.1`!

**Hooray it's `v1.0.0` time!** This doesn't mean that we won't be changing little things anymore, but we're so far happy with our API and trust Graphcache to work correctly. We will further iterate on this version with some **planned features**, like "fragment invalidation", garbage collection, and more.

This version refactors the **cache resolvers** and adds some new special powers to them! You can now return almost anything from cache resolvers and trust that it'll do the right thing:

- You can return entity keys, which will resolve the cached entities
- You can return keyable entities, which will also be resolved from cache
- You may also return unkeyable entities, which will be partially resolved from cache, with your resolved values taking precedence

This can also be nested, so that unkeyable entities can eventually lead back to normal, cached entities!

This has enabled us to expose the `relayPagination()` helper! This is a resolver that you can just drop into the `cacheExchange`'s `resolvers` config. It automatically does Relay-style pagination, which is now possible due to our more powerful resolvers! You can import it from `@urql/exchange-graphcache/extras`.

- ✨ Add full cache resolver traversal (see [#91](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql-exchange-graphcache/pull/91))

## [v1.0.0-rc.1](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql-exchange-graphcache/compare/v1.0.0-rc.0...v1.0.0-rc.1)

This is the first release that adds _schema awareness_. Passing a schema to Graphcache allows it to make deterministic
assumptions about the cached results it generates from its data. It can deterministically match fragments to interfaces,
instead of resorting to a heuristic, and it can provide _partial results_ for queries. With a `schema` passed to Graphcache,
as long as only nullable fields are uncached and missing, it will still provide an initial cached result.

- ✨ Add schema awareness using the `schema` option (see [#58](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql-exchange-graphcache/pull/58))
- ✨ Allow for partial results to cascade missing values upwards (see [#59](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql-exchange-graphcache/pull/59))
- Fix `store.keyOfEntity` not using root names from the schema (see [#62](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql-exchange-graphcache/pull/62))
