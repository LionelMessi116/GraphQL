# @urql/exchange-persisted-fetch

## 0.1.2

### Patch Changes

- Add a `"./package.json"` entry to the `package.json`'s `"exports"` field for Node 14. This seems to be required by packages like `rollup-plugin-svelte` to function properly, by [@JoviDeCroock](https://github.com/JoviDeCroock) (See [#771](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/771))
- Updated dependencies (See [#771](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/771))
  - @urql/core@1.11.6

## 0.1.1

### Patch Changes

- ⚠️ Fix `persistedFetchExchange` not sending the SHA256 hash extension after a cache miss (`PersistedQueryNotFound` error), by [@kitten](https://github.com/kitten) (See [#766](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/766))

## 0.1.0

This is the initial release of `@urql/exchange-persisted-fetch` which adds Persisted Queries
support, and is an exchange that can be used alongside the default `fetchExchange` or
`@urql/exchange-multipart-fetch`.

It's still experimental, just like `@urql/exchange-multipart-fetch`, so please test it with care and
report any bugs you find.
